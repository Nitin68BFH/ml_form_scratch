# Linear Regression: From Scratch vs Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Regression from scratch** using only Python and NumPy, and compares it with the built-in implementation from **scikit-learn**.  
A synthetic dataset is generated to test and validate both models.

## ⚡ What’s Inside
- Implementation of **Linear Regression from scratch** (no ML libraries).
- Training on a **synthetic dataset** (generated using NumPy).
- Model evaluation using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score
- **Comparison with scikit-learn’s `LinearRegression`**.
- Visualization of regression line and predictions.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:
```

git clone https://github.com/Nitin68BFH/ml_from_scratch.git
cd ml_from_scratch/linear_regression
```

📊 Results
```
The scratch implementation produces results very close to scikit-learn’s LinearRegression.
Both regression lines overlap nicely on the synthetic dataset.
Error metrics (MSE, R²) confirm the correctness of the scratch model.
